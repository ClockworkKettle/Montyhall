# Montyhall Simulator
For those of us who have struggled with the monty hall problem, the aim of this project is to create a monty hall simulator and observe the results.

The Monty Hall Problem can be explained as follows:

Given three doors, one which contains a car, the other two goats.
A player is given a choice of which door the car is behind.
The host, reveals a goat behind one of the doors and asks the player if they would like to change their choice of door.

It is expected that the changing of choice will lead to choosing the correct door in more scenarios than not changing.
